		<p><em>Siber</em> pronounced "Cyber" is a very humorous person, many people believe that he should ply himself to stand-up comedy with his jovial anecdotes. He likes to go bowling, watch movies with friends, and being a child of the eighties loves video-games.<br> The reason I can share so much about <em>Siber</em>, is the fact that <em>Siber</em> is <strong>Me</strong>!</p>

		<p><span>I</span> had a wonderful vacation with my co-workers when we went to Fort Lauderdale for a bachelor party. Went spent 3 days on the beach , with fun, sand, water, and beautiful companions. It was truly a highlight of my life.</p>
		<p> I believe that Robin Williams light was dimmed all too soon. He was an unparalled vocal actor, a character that you could always relate to, and a loving person off screen.,<br> I know that we as a community need to strive to understand depression, and the signs of our loved ones struggles with it.</p>

		<h2>My Vehicle</h2>
		<p>I own a gently-used silver 2010 Kia Forte, She has been my trusty stallion through my career with Pizza Hut. I have not been the best owner for her she has many character marks, including a deep dent on her posterior from a run-in <em>literally</em> with a mail box. Although she is not the prettiest automobile, she is my <strong>car</strong>.</p></div>
